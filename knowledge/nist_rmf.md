\# NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) — Security Risk Thinking Model



The NIST Risk Management Framework provides a structured approach for identifying, analyzing, and managing security risk in organizational systems.



Rather than focusing on individual vulnerabilities, RMF emphasizes risk as a function of impact, likelihood, and context.



\## Core Risk Concepts

Risk is determined by:

\- Threat likelihood

\- Vulnerability presence

\- Potential impact on business objectives



Security decisions should always be contextual, not purely technical.



\## RMF High-Level Phases

1\. Categorize systems based on business impact

2\. Select appropriate security controls

3\. Implement controls in a measured and documented way

4\. Assess control effectiveness

5\. Authorize systems based on risk tolerance

6\. Continuously monitor risk posture



\## Strategic Value

RMF helps organizations:

\- Align security with business priorities

\- Avoid over- or under-investing in controls

\- Communicate risk clearly to non-technical stakeholders



\## Assessment Implications

When applying RMF thinking:

\- Not all vulnerabilities represent equal risk

\- Context and compensating controls matter

\- Risk acceptance may be valid in certain scenarios



Security assessments informed by RMF focus on decision support, not vulnerability enumeration.
