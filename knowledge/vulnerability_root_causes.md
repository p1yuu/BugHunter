\# Vulnerability Root Causes

\## Understanding Why Security Issues Exist



\## Purpose

This document defines the fundamental root causes from which the vast majority

of security vulnerabilities emerge. Rather than cataloging individual flaws,

it provides a reasoning framework to understand \*why\* vulnerabilities appear

across different technologies, systems, and eras.



Nearly all security issues are manifestations of a small number of recurring

design, trust, or assumption failures.

\## Core Principle



Vulnerabilities are symptoms.

Root causes are structural.



A system that fixes symptoms without addressing root causes will repeatedly

produce new vulnerabilities.

\## Root Cause 1: Incorrect Trust in Input



\### Description

Systems frequently assume that input is:

\- Well-formed

\- Honest

\- Safe

\- Intended



This assumption is often implicit and undocumented.



\### Why It Happens

\- Over-reliance on client-side controls

\- Incomplete validation strategies

\- Historical design decisions that no longer hold



\### Typical Impact

\- Data integrity compromise

\- Unauthorized behavior

\- Logic manipulation



\### Key Insight

Any input crossing a trust boundary must be treated as untrusted by default.

\## Root Cause 2: Broken Authorization Logic



\### Description

Authorization failures occur when a system:

\- Confuses authentication with authorization

\- Applies access checks inconsistently

\- Relies on UI-level restrictions instead of server-side enforcement



\### Why It Happens

\- Complex business rules

\- Rapid feature growth

\- Decentralized authorization logic



\### Typical Impact

\- Unauthorized access to data or actions

\- Privilege escalation

\- Cross-user data exposure



\### Key Insight

Authorization is a business logic problem, not a technical afterthought.

\## Root Cause 3: Incomplete State and Lifecycle Management



\### Description

Many vulnerabilities arise when systems fail to properly manage:

\- Object state

\- Session lifecycle

\- Workflow transitions



\### Why It Happens

\- Assumptions about sequence

\- Race conditions at the design level

\- Lack of explicit state modeling



\### Typical Impact

\- Inconsistent behavior

\- Bypass of intended controls

\- Unexpected privilege retention



\### Key Insight

Security controls must be enforced across the entire lifecycle, not just at entry points.

\## Root Cause 4: Implicit Trust Between Components



\### Description

Modern systems consist of multiple interacting components.

Vulnerabilities emerge when components trust each other without verification.



\### Why It Happens

\- Internal network assumptions

\- Microservice complexity

\- Legacy integration patterns



\### Typical Impact

\- Lateral movement potential

\- Expanded blast radius

\- Cascading failures



\### Key Insight

Internal systems are not inherently trustworthy.

\## Root Cause 5: Misconfiguration and Unsafe Defaults



\### Description

Systems often ship with configurations that prioritize usability or speed

over security.



\### Why It Happens

\- Convenience-driven defaults

\- Incomplete documentation

\- Assumption that users will harden systems



\### Typical Impact

\- Unintended exposure

\- Weak isolation

\- Excessive permissions



\### Key Insight

Secure systems fail safely by default.

\## Root Cause 6: Incorrect Use of Security Mechanisms



\### Description

Security mechanisms are present but applied incorrectly or incompletely.



\### Why It Happens

\- Partial understanding of controls

\- Cargo-cult security

\- Copy-paste implementations



\### Typical Impact

\- False sense of security

\- Bypassable protections

\- Compliance without real protection



\### Key Insight

Using a security mechanism is not the same as using it correctly.

\## Root Cause 7: Dependency and Supply Chain Assumptions



\### Description

Modern software relies heavily on third-party components.



\### Why It Happens

\- Transitive dependencies

\- Lack of ownership visibility

\- Trust in upstream maintainers



\### Typical Impact

\- Inherited risk

\- Indirect compromise

\- Delayed detection



\### Key Insight

Every dependency extends the trust boundary.

\## Root Cause 8: Human and Process Failures



\### Description

Not all vulnerabilities are technical.

Many originate from human decisions and organizational processes.



\### Why It Happens

\- Time pressure

\- Ambiguous ownership

\- Poor communication

\- Misaligned incentives



\### Typical Impact

\- Configuration drift

\- Inconsistent enforcement

\- Delayed remediation



\### Key Insight

Security failures often reflect process weaknesses more than code defects.

\## Applying Root Cause Reasoning



When analyzing a system, always ask:

\- Which root cause is present?

\- Why does this assumption exist?

\- What would happen if it fails?

\- Is the risk systemic or localized?



This approach enables reasoning about both known and unknown vulnerabilities.



---



\## Key Takeaway



New vulnerabilities are rarely new ideas.

They are familiar failures expressed in new contexts.



Understanding root causes allows security professionals to:

\- Anticipate risk

\- Prioritize effectively

\- Design more resilient systems
