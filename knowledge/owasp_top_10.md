\# OWASP Top 10 — Strategic Security Risk Overview



The OWASP Top 10 represents the most common and impactful categories of web application security risks observed across real-world assessments.



These categories do not represent individual vulnerabilities, but classes of systemic weaknesses that often indicate deeper architectural or process-level issues.



\## Why OWASP Top 10 Matters

\- Widely adopted industry reference for web application risk

\- Frequently used by auditors, consultants, and regulators

\- Strong indicator of security maturity gaps when issues are present



\## High-Level Risk Categories

Common OWASP risk areas include:

\- Broken Access Control

\- Cryptographic Failures

\- Injection Risks

\- Insecure Design

\- Security Misconfiguration

\- Vulnerable and Outdated Components

\- Identification and Authentication Failures

\- Software and Data Integrity Failures

\- Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

\- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)



\## Risk Perspective

The presence of issues related to OWASP Top 10 categories often suggests:

\- Insufficient security-by-design practices

\- Weak threat modeling during development

\- Gaps in secure coding standards or review processes



\## Business Impact

Failures in these areas can lead to:

\- Unauthorized access to sensitive data

\- Regulatory and compliance exposure

\- Reputational damage

\- Loss of customer trust



\## Assessment Implications

When an application shows indicators related to OWASP Top 10 categories, further focused security assessment may be warranted to understand:

\- Scope and systemic nature of the risk

\- Potential business impact

\- Effectiveness of existing security controls
