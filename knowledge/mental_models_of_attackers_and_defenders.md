\# Mental Models of Attackers and Defenders

\## Understanding How Security Actors Think



\## Purpose

This document defines the cognitive models used by attackers and defenders

to reason about systems, risk, and opportunity.



Security failures often occur not due to lack of controls,

but due to misunderstandings of how adversaries think.

\## 1. Attacker Mental Models



Attackers do not think in terms of “vulnerabilities” alone.

They think in terms of:



\- Entry points

\- Trust boundaries

\- Mistakes

\- Incentives

\- Time and effort



Attackers seek:

\- The easiest path, not the most sophisticated one

\- Weak links, not perfect exploits

\- Reusable access, not single wins



---



\## 2. Common Attacker Questions



An attacker mentally asks:

\- “What can I reach without authentication?”

\- “Where does the system trust user input?”

\- “What was assumed to never fail?”

\- “What is monitored poorly?”

\- “What breaks quietly?”

\## 3. Opportunistic vs Targeted Attacks



\### Opportunistic Attackers:

\- Scan broadly

\- Exploit known weaknesses

\- Move on quickly



\### Targeted Attackers:

\- Study architecture

\- Abuse business logic

\- Combine small weaknesses

\- Remain patient



Security posture must consider both.

\## 4. Defender Mental Models



Defenders often think in terms of:

\- Controls

\- Policies

\- Compliance

\- Coverage



This can lead to:

\- Checkbox security

\- Overreliance on tools

\- Blind spots in assumptions



Effective defenders think in \*\*failure modes\*\*, not features.



---



\## 5. Defensive Questions That Matter



Strong defenders ask:

\- “What happens if this control fails?”

\- “Who notices first if this breaks?”

\- “What is the blast radius?”

\- “What assumptions are we making?”

\- “How could this be misused?”

\## 6. Misalignment Between Attackers and Defenders



Attackers:

\- Exploit edge cases

\- Abuse trust

\- Chain behaviors



Defenders:

\- Secure the happy path

\- Protect documented flows

\- Focus on known risks



This gap is where most breaches occur.

\## 7. The Power of Chaining Weak Signals



Major incidents rarely start with:

\- A single critical flaw



They often start with:

\- Minor misconfigurations

\- Overlooked permissions

\- Poor logging

\- Human assumptions



Understanding how small issues combine is critical.

\## 8. Cognitive Biases in Security



Common biases:

\- Normalcy bias (“It hasn’t happened before”)

\- Overconfidence in tools

\- Underestimating human error

\- Assuming attackers think like defenders



Security analysis must actively counter these biases.

\## 9. Strategic Thinking for Security Advisors



A mature advisor:

\- Thinks like an attacker

\- Communicates like an executive

\- Designs like an engineer



They bridge gaps between:

\- Technology and risk

\- Controls and reality

\- Policy and behavior

\## 10. Role of the AI Assistant



A responsible AI assistant should:

\- Surface hidden assumptions

\- Challenge mental shortcuts

\- Highlight asymmetric risks

\- Encourage adversarial thinking without execution



The assistant supports reasoning —

not exploitation.

\## Key Takeaway



Security is not about knowing every vulnerability.

It is about understanding how systems fail

when people make assumptions.



Thinking correctly is more powerful than scanning more.
