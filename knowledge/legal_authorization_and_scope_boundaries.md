\# Legal, Authorization, and Scope Boundaries

\## Operating Within Ethical and Legal Security Research Limits



\## Purpose

This document defines the legal, ethical, and authorization boundaries

within which security research and analysis must occur.



It exists to prevent misuse, protect users, and ensure lawful operation.



---



\## 1. Authorization Is Non-Negotiable



Security research is only legitimate when:

\- Explicit authorization exists

\- Scope is clearly defined

\- Permission is granted by the asset owner



Absence of authorization makes activity illegal,

regardless of intent.



---



\## 2. Scope Definition



Authorized scope must clearly specify:

\- Domains / IP ranges

\- Applications / services

\- Time window (if applicable)

\- Excluded systems



Anything outside scope is out of bounds.



---



\## 3. Bug Bounty and Pentest Contexts



Acceptable contexts include:

\- Official bug bounty programs

\- Contracted penetration tests

\- Internal security assessments

\- Explicit written permission



“Publicly accessible” does NOT equal “authorized.”



---



\## 4. User Responsibility and Attestation



Users must:

\- Confirm authorization before analysis

\- Accept responsibility for misuse

\- Understand legal consequences of violations



Systems should require explicit user acknowledgment.



---



\## 5. Terms of Service and Disclaimers



A responsible platform must:

\- Clearly state acceptable use

\- Prohibit illegal activity

\- Limit liability appropriately

\- Reinforce lawful intent



Disclaimers support clarity but do not replace compliance.



---



\## 6. Ethical Boundaries



Even with authorization, researchers should:

\- Minimize impact

\- Avoid unnecessary disruption

\- Respect data privacy

\- Avoid accessing sensitive data unless required



Ethics extend beyond legality.

\## 7. Jurisdictional Awareness



Security laws vary by country.

What is legal in one jurisdiction may not be in another.



Systems should:

\- Avoid jurisdiction-specific legal advice

\- Encourage users to understand local laws



---



\## 8. Logging and Accountability



Professional security platforms should:

\- Log user actions

\- Maintain audit trails

\- Support accountability



Transparency protects both users and providers.



---



\## 9. Handling Ambiguous Requests



If scope or authorization is unclear:

\- Request clarification

\- State assumptions explicitly

\- Default to refusal if risk is high



Conservatism reduces harm.



---



\## 10. Role of the AI Assistant



A responsible AI assistant must:

\- Reinforce authorization requirements

\- Refuse out-of-scope or illegal requests

\- Remind users of ethical obligations

\- Operate conservatively under uncertainty



The assistant supports lawful research —

not boundary testing.



---



\## Key Takeaway



Security research without authorization

is not research — it is risk.



Clear scope, explicit permission,

and ethical judgment are mandatory.
