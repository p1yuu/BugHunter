## 🔴 IDOR / Broken Access Control

**Why you should care:**  
If object IDs are not properly authorized, you may access other users’ data.

**Start here:** Any URL or API call containing numeric or UUID IDs

**What to do (exact steps):**
1. Log in as a normal user
2. Capture a request containing an ID
3. Change the ID and resend the request

**Bug bounty verdict:**  
✔ Very likely to produce a valid report if access is granted

## 🟠 Public / Weak API Endpoints

**Why you should care:**  
Unauthenticated or weak APIs often expose sensitive business logic.


**What to do (exact steps):**
1. Send requests without authentication
2. Remove Authorization headers
3. Modify user_id or object references

**Bug bounty verdict:**  
✔ Medium–High chance depending on data exposure

## 🟡 Client-Side Trust Issues

**Why you should care:**  
Frontend restrictions are sometimes not enforced server-side.

**What to do (exact steps):**
1. Observe frontend requests in DevTools
2. Replay them manually (Burp / curl)
3. Remove or modify restricted parameters

**Bug bounty verdict:**  
✔ Situational but often overlooked
